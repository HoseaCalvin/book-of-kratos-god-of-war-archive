# God of War: Unofficial Fan Site

This fan-made website lets user discover enthralling aspects, ranging from gameplay overviews to the spelndor of the Nine Realms.

## üéØ Objective

Driven by my profound love for God of War games set in Norse mythology, I developed my fan website that brings together content from both God of War and God of War Ragnar√∂k.

To ensure there are no critical issues such as usability and performance, I designed the website to be user-friendly and have a visual that reflects both God of War and Norse mythology aesthetics.

In addition, this fan-made website focuses on gameplay overviews, deep lore behind each prominent character, and the grandeur and the brutality of the Nine Realms. I implemented an engaging quiz game to test users' knowledge of both games.
