                            Hence, a humble abode was built by Freyr and his allies, its utilities crafted from nature's gifts.
                            In the times of silence, they would gather near the glimmering campfire to howl their songs.

                            Adjacent to an abandoned Vanir settlement, Eastern Barri Woods was an important region for its bygone villagers.
                            Now only desecrated temples stand while the Einherjar thrived from its destruction, a grim legacy of the Aesir-Vanir war.
                            Special memories formed within now overlapped by blood and flesh.

                            On the other side lies another prairie, bordered by a wide ravine.

                            The souls of the departed attested that a fierce duel between an Aesir an a Jötnar took place, demolishing settlements around.
                            In addition, who faced a dreary fate were the innocent folks at the settlements.
                            As of now, only ghosts and spirits occupy the vacant lands.
