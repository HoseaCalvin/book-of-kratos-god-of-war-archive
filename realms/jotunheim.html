                        Once a thriving sanctuary of the giants, Jötunheim has become a graveyard of its own inhabitants. <br/>
                        Monumental corpses and etches of destruction have spoiled its breathtaking view since the wrath of the Aesir first descended.
                        As a consequence, a number of giants fled in agony, or chose to remain to protect what matters the most.
                        Moreover, no visitors, not even the heinous Aesir gods, have been able to step foot on the realm.

                            Regarded as the highest point in all of Nine Realms, this unnamed peak was an altar of their kind.
                            Its purpose remains unknown to the outside world, brought far away by the giants who sought shelter elsewhere or lost their soul.
                            As of now, this forsaken place stands as a commemoration of those who settled to Midgard.

                            The forest of the Jötnar, known as Ironwood, is a haven of the Jötnar refugees and a major habitat of the wildlife.
                            Those who survived the Aesir attacks are thought to have been entrenched in the woods, consequently driving Odin to confirm the rumor.
                            Continuous failed attempts have caused Odin to abandon his quest, leaving the region an unsolved mystery.

                            The corpses echoing their sorrows, flooding the fields with blood and tears, etching a dreadful mark on the realm.
                            Though their souls are absent, they will forever be the protectors of Jötunheim until Ragnarök storms the universe.
