                        Asgard, known as Asgarðr in Old Norse, is the celestial realm of the Aesir, where the All-Father presides over the Nine Realms with unmatched authority.
                        This divine kingdom is home to mighty gods such as Thor, Heimdall, and Baldur, each playing a crucial role in the cosmic order. <br>
                        A realm of unparalleled splendor, Asgard is the embodiment of every mortal's dream, a land of verdant landscapes and eternal sunlight.
                        Its architectural grandeur, a testament to divine craftsmanship, leaves even the most imaginative minds in awe.

                            The plain of Asgard, known as Plains of Ida or Iðavöllr, is the main terrain of this majestic home of the Aesir. <br>
                            Featuring rugged terrains, gleaming waters, and fertility, it is where the Midgardian refugees toil to survive from the eternal winter, Fimbulwinter.
                            High above the plain is where the ethereal rainbow bridge, Bifrost, spans across the horizon that serves as a pathway to other realms.

                            Engulfing the opulent residences, Hrimthur's Wall serves as an ultimate defense to hinder mighty enemies from marching into Glaðsheim.
                            Its towering structure adds another layer of difficulty for the elves and the Jotnar to trespass beyond. <br>
                            The structure was initially abandoned, but continued by a giant named Hrimthur, provided the All-Father fulfills his promise.
                            However, the cunning Jotnar adds a concealed structural flaw within the wall, unbeknownst to the All-Father himself.

                            The heart of Asgard, Glaðsheim, is home to the privileged townspeople of the Aesir and the slain warriors called Einherjar.
                            It mimicks the typical Norse architectures, wood being the main foundation of the structure. 
                            However, The Aesir promote opulence and brilliance by ingraining fine arts — carving the wood into exquisite patterns that distinguish their architecture.
