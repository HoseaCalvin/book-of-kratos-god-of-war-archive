                <h1>My Passion</h1>
                <p>
                    Driven by my profound love for God of War games set in Norse mythology, I developed my fan website that brings together content from both God of War and God of War Ragnar√∂k.
                    To ensure there are no critical issues such as usability and performance, I designed the website to be user-friendly and have a visual that reflects both God of War and Norse mythology aesthetics.
                    In addition, this fan-made website focuses on gameplay overviews, deep lore behind each prominent character, and the grandeur and the brutality of the Nine Realms.
